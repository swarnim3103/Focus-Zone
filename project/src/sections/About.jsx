          but in all seriousness i made this projet for following reasons:

          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              <span className="">Sometimes it takes something easy and less tense to connect with people this may seem like a simple project but what i tried was to play around and bond with other country . It does not take a serious meeting of officials but simple fact as that mamushi the famous song of megan thee stallion is a snake species from japan and then you go in rabbit hole in japanese culture.</span> 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="">It is a simple 3D globe where when you click on coutry it shows the native snake species of that country</span> 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
